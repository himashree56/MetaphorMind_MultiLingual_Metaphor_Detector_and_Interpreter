# Multilingual Metaphor Detection System

A production-ready NLP system for detecting metaphors in **Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada** using fine-tuned transformer models.
The project includes a **FastAPI backend**, **React frontend**, training scripts, and detailed documentation.
All trained models are hosted on **Hugging Face** and are automatically downloaded at runtime.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Multilingual metaphor detection (4 Indian languages)
* Sentence-level and paragraph-level analysis
* 5-layer AI interpretation (translation, literal, emotional, philosophical, cultural)
* REST API built with FastAPI
* Interactive React frontend
* Speech-to-text input (Web Speech API)
* Optional history tracking using MongoDB
* Clean separation of code and models (industry best practice)

---

## 📝 How Paragraph Detection & Interpretation Works

When a paragraph (multi-sentence input) is submitted:

* The backend splits the text into individual sentences using both English and Indic punctuation.
* Each sentence is analyzed for metaphoric content **individually**.
* For every sentence, a 5-layer AI interpretation is generated.

### Context-Aware Metaphor Detection

* If a sentence is detected as a metaphor, it becomes the *anchor* for the next sentence.
* If the next sentence is classified as *normal* but follows a metaphor, the backend re-evaluates it using the previous metaphor sentence as context.
* If the context-aware check finds a metaphor, the label is updated to **metaphor**.
* If two consecutive sentences are *normal*, the context chain is broken.
* This allows metaphors that depend on prior context to be detected, not just isolated sentences.

The API returns a detailed, per-sentence analysis and interpretation for the whole paragraph, along with a summary label and confidence.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional (for history feature)
# Use localhost OR placeholders for MongoDB Atlas
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
# OR
# MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<db-name>

MONGODB_DB_NAME=metaphor_detector
```

Get a Gemini API key from:
[https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

---

### 2️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ (Optional) Set Up MongoDB

MongoDB is **optional**.
The application works without it, but history will be disabled.

See: [MONGODB_SETUP.md](MONGODB_SETUP.md)

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

### Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

### Start Frontend (New Terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will open at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---
